<h1>Welcome to the University Enrollment System! ðŸŽ“</h1>

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This is **UNIVERSITY_ENROLLMENT**, a Java-based application that helps manage student enrollments in a university. Whether itâ€™s adding students, managing courses, or tracking enrollments, this system has you covered. Itâ€™s powered by JDBC to connect to a database and handle all the behind-the-scenes data magic.

<h3>What Does It Do?</h3>

**Hereâ€™s what this project can help with:**

**Student Management:** Easily add, update, delete, or view student details.

**Course Management:** Create and manage courses, including their IDs, names, and credits.

**Enrollments:** Enroll students in courses and keep everything organized.

**Database Connectivity:** Connects seamlessly to databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL using JDBC.

<h3>what Youâ€™ll Need</h3>

Before you get started, make sure you have the following ready:

**Java JDK:** Version 8 or later.

**Database Server:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any database that works with JDBC.

**JDBC Driver:** The right driver for your database (e.g., MySQL Connector/J).

**IDE (Optional):** Use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java IDE to make development easier.

<h2>How to Run It</h2>

Ready to dive in? Hereâ€™s how you can get it up and running:

**Clone the Project:** First, download the project files:

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UNIVERSITY_ENROLLMENT.git

**Set Up the Database:**

Create a new database in your preferred DBMS (like MySQL).

If a setup script (schema.sql) is included, import it to create the necessary tables:

bash

Copy code

mysql -u your_username -p your_database < schema.sql

Configure the Database Connection: In the code, update the connection details to match your database setup. Youâ€™ll usually find this in a file or class like DatabaseConnection:

***Change the UserName and Password in  the below cose so it could work properly.**

java

Copy code

String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/university";

String user = "your_username";

String password = "your_password";

Compile and Run the Code:

Compile the files:

bash

Copy code

javac *.java

**Start the application:**

bash

Copy code

java Main

Explore the Features: Use the terminal or GUI (if implemented) to manage students, courses, and enrollments.

**Whatâ€™s Inside?**

**Main.java:** The starting point of the application.

**Student.java:** Manages all things related to students.

**Course.java:** Handles course information.

**Enrollment.java:** Takes care of student-course enrollments.

**DatabaseConnection.java:** Sets up the connection to the database using JDBC.

<h3>Whatâ€™s Next?</h3>

This project is just getting started, and thereâ€™s so much more we can add:

A user-friendly interface built with JavaFX or Swing.

Secure login with roles like **"admin"** and **"student."**

Better error handling and logging for debugging.

Support for more types of databases.
